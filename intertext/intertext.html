<div class="leftblock">Ladies and Gentlemen! You've read about it in the papers! Now witness, before your very eyes, that most rare and tragic of nature's mistakes! I give you: the average man. Physically unremarkable, it instead possesses a deformed set of values. Notice the hideously bloated sense of humanity's importance. Also note the club-footed social conscience and the withered optimism. It's certainly not for the squeamish, is it?</div>
<div class="rightblock">And then there are unthinking, animal types who seem to be satisfied with a purely physical sense of power. The good soldier, who gets his sense of power by developing fighting skills that he is quite content to use in blind obedience to his superiors.</div>
<div class="heading">Mad random pointless</div>
